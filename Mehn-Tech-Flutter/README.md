A new Mobile project .Service Marketplace: It connects service providers (workshops and professionals) with customers who need manual services like maintenance, cleaning, and repairs.
 An interactive mobile application to meet people's needs for manual services
 The audience benefiting from this application are primarily professional workshops and those with handicrafts and competencies
 Then the benefit will be reflected on users who need professional services (electricity, sanitation, maintenance, cleaning, etc.)
 The basis of the project
 It is the ability to book and organize appointments between users and workshops without the intervention of people to connect two parties. These are some of the features of the application:
 - Preventing exploitation of the user, giving him a first look at the cost of maintenance for the workforce before confirming the request, and preventing embarrassment to the user
 - Preventing fake requests through a specific blocking policy that prevents users from tampering with appointments
 - The possibility of evaluating the workshop by the user after completing the maintenance process. This is what leads to raising the level of work and the interest of workshops in the quality of work.
 - Showing the workshops specialized in the selected sector within the city that the user has chosen
 - A list of advertisements funded by the workshops that appears to users throughout the funding period
 - The ability to search for specific workshops and filter the results by evaluations or by name
 - The possibility of changing the place of work and place of application when moving from one city to another
 - Customer service center to respond to complaints and solve problems
